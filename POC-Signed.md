### Technical Analysis: The VHD > ISO > RTLO > Hidden DLL Sideloading Chain

This execution sequence is a highly calculated stack of defense-evasion tactics. Each individual mechanism is designed to solve a specific problem for an attacker-ranging from defeating secure email gateways to tricking the end-user and bypassing endpoint detection (EDR).

When combined, they form a highly effective initial access pipeline.

1. **Delivery:** The user downloads or receives an ISO file.
2. **First Mount:** The user double-clicks the VHD, mounting it as a second virtual hard drive. Inside are the actual execution files.
3. **Second Mount:** The user double-clicks the ISO, mounting it as a virtual disc drive. Inside is a hidden or visible VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) file.
4. **Masquerading Techniques**
*   **File Hiding:** The malicious proxy DLL (`.dll`) is marked with the `Hidden` file attribute inside the VHD structure. This ensures that a standard user browsing the mounted drive only sees the primary launcher file.
*   **RTLO Unicode Spoofing:** The legitimately signed Canon executable uses the Right-to-Left Override Unicode character (`U+202E`) to trick the user into thinking they are opening a safe document format:
    *   *Apparent name seen by user:* `Document_fdp.exe`
    *   *Actual execution target:* `Document_[RTLO]fdp.exe` (which interprets the system extension as an executable while reversing the string sequence visually).


Powershell RTLO
```   
# Define the literal RLO character using its hex code
$rlo = [char]0x202E

# Combine the pieces to form the final filename
$newName = "document_" + $rlo + "fdpm.exe"

# Rename the file
Rename-Item -Path "document.pdf.exe" -NewName $newName
```


5. **Execution:** The user runs a legitimately signed Canon Executable.
6. **DLL Hijacking:** The Canon executable automatically looks for and loads a companion Proxy DLL placed in the same folder.
7. **Trigger:** The DLL executes the final payload, spawning calc.exe.
